## :wave: Contributing

### :page_with_curl: `manifesto.yaml`

If you want to contribute to the manifesto, edit `manifesto.yaml` and suggest your pull request. A few notes to remember:

* Typos, english corrections - more than welcome
* Bullet additions - will be requiring a deeper review. We want to keep it DRY, simple, and it should be a significant enough addition in its insight/practice to get in.
* Category addition - same process as in bullet additions, just be mindful that we can't have too many categories (we want to keep a reasonable size).
* Misc - if you do add items, have good references if you can.

When in doubt, you can always open an issue to discuss _before_ opening a new PR.


###  :information_desk_person: `people.yaml`

If you're very passionate about developer experience, and are dealing with the subject in your day-to-day, you can suggest yourself to be included (submit a PR). Not all PRs will be accepted.



### :factory: `companies.yaml`

If you represent a company, you can add a PR to add your company logo. Some criteria:

1. This company has to develop a product that is meant for developers, _or_, this company is known for _caring_ about developer experience (invests significant time in building tools, and processes)
2. We don't need any sponsorship funds _yet_ so we are not accepting sponsorshipts. But if you would like to sponsor -- let us know


## :star2: Code of Conduct

Please note that we have our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Let's create a pleasant atmosphere for everyone.
